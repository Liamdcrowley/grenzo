  <h1>Grenzo Primer</h1>

  <p>Hello Sam B.</p>

  <p>
    This is a quickstart primer for your new commander —
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo, Dungeon Warden</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>The Commander</h2>

  <p>
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>
    cheats out creatures of power less than or equal to his power from the bottom of your library.
    There are 56 creatures in this deck. None of them have power greater than 3. Thus, you should
    only ever cast
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>
    for X = 1.
  </p>

  <p>
    Generally, the creatures that you cheat out will either be value generation, or combo pieces
    (or tutors for those combo pieces, or even tutor/combo pieces in one card). Use the value pieces
    to stay alive, and to get you to those combo pieces faster. Use the combo pieces to win. Easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of the value comes in the form of goblin tokens. Think of them like fuel, almost like your
    food tokens in hobbits, except they can block too. For example, you can sac goblins to
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar">Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar</span>
    for card draw;
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Skirk Prospector">Skirk Prospector</span>
    for mana;
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Siege-Gang Commander">Siege-Gang Commander</span>
    for creature/planeswalker removal; or
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Woe Strider">Woe Strider</span>
    /
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Viscera Seer">Viscera Seer</span>
    for scry. Scrying is particularly good in this deck, as you can chuck a creature on the bottom for a
    guaranteed
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>
    hit. Generally they will not be great attackers, but there are a couple of lords, and I could see
    them doing enough damage to finish someone off with something like
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Krenko, Mob Boss">Krenko, Mob Boss</span>
    plus
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Goblin Lookout">Goblin Lookout</span>
    for example. But for the most part, when you win, you will be killing all players at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The greatest value piece in this deck (
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Heartstone">Heartstone</span>
    ) unfortunately cannot be cheated out, and if it hits the grave, it is quite hard to get back. If you see it in
    an opening hand, keep that hand (within reason). Get that shit out and have fun spewing cards out from the bottom
    of your deck.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, there are three important rulings for <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>'s ability 
    <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/CNS/en-us/47/grenzo-dungeon-warden?fbclid=IwY2xjawObOzlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFteTlra1gzbFo4UlZpSmlMc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHoBUp89Xe4qEvyV1xRwyU9ls6v8vbJS86uvmGgA4PlEINGcIib6cwMFVDRPM_aem_ha4BbLqWOVZKLyssSkX80g" 
      target="_blank"
      style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: inherit;">
      here.
    </a>
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 0; font: inherit; color: inherit;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">
      "Compare Grenzo's power when the ability resolves with the power of the creature card in your graveyard to determine if you put it onto the battlefield. If Grenzo isn't on the battlefield at this time, use its last known power from when it was on the battlefield."
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">
      "If the card is a creature card with power less than or equal to Grenzo's power, it's put onto the battlefield from your graveyard, not from your library. Players can't attempt to exile it from your graveyard in response."
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">
      "If a replacement effect (such as that of Leyline of the Void) causes the card to be put from your library directly into exile, you'll put it onto the battlefield from exile if it's a creature card with appropriate power."
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In short, Grenzo is harder to fuck with than you may initially think.</p>


  <h2>The Combos (how you win)</h2>

  <p>
    Use and abuse the four tutor cards in this deck to get your combos out. There are a few infinite
    combos in this deck. These are the ones I know of.
  </p>

  <h3>Kiki-Jiki / Zealous Conscripts</h3>

  <p>
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</span>
    copies
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Zealous Conscripts">Zealous Conscripts</span>,
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Zealous Conscripts">Zealous Conscripts</span>
    untaps
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</span>.
    Repeat. Swing out with infinite hasted Conscripts. For extra salt when you do, call it a combat win.
  </p>

  <h3>Murderous Redcap / Metallic Mimic</h3>

  <p>
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Murderous Redcap">Murderous Redcap</span>
    enters with a persist counter, and deals damage to any target.
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Metallic Mimic">Metallic Mimic</span>
    means that if Redcap were to die and re-enter from persist, the +1/+1 counter cancels out the -1/-1. Pair that with
    any sac-outlet and sac-ping ad infinitum.
  </p>

  <h3>Heartstone, Bottom Library, Infinite Mana</h3>

  <p>
    With
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Heartstone">Heartstone</span>,
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>’s ability costs 1 mana. It also
    means that cards like
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Tomb Trawler">Tomb Trawler</span>
    or
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Barkform Harvester">Barkform Harvester</span>
    only cost one mana for their abilities. Pair that with a sac-outlet and a ritual such as
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Priest of Urabrask">Priest of Urabrask</span>
    or
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Priest of Gix">Priest of Gix</span>,
    and you now net one mana every time you loop graveyard → bottom of library →
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>
    ability. From here you can really do whatever. Grenzo-ing out your entire deck will probably just win you the game.
    One example line: If your sac-outlet scrys, find
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar">Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar</span>,
    Grenzo her out, then scry for
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Goblin Bombardment">Goblin Bombardment</span>,
    draw it with
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar">Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar</span>,
    and play it to loop-ping people to death.
  </p>

  <h3>Kiki-Jiki / Conspicuous Snoop / Sling-Gang Lieutenant</h3>

  <h3>Kiki-Jiki / Conspicuous Snoop / Sling-Gang Lieutenant</h3>

  <p>
    This combo is maybe the easiest to get out, but it is somewhat telegraphed, as it requires
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    on the battlefield and not summoning sick. It’s basically a one card combo with
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Goblin Recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</span>.
    Use Recruiter to get
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    and
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</span>
    to the top of your library in that order (or just
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</span>
    if Snoop is already on the battlefield/in your hand). With 
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span> 
    on the battlefield, and
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</span>
    on the top of your library, tap 
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    using Kiki’s ability to copy itself infinitely. Then, tap 
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    to copy
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Goblin Recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</span>
    and get
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Sling-Gang Lieutenant">Sling-Gang Lieutenant</span>
    to the top of your library. Sac all the copies and ping to death. This combo also works with a
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Boggart Harbinger">Boggart Harbinger</span>
    instead of the Recruiter. The strongest part of this combo is how easy it is to assemble. The weakest part is that
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    must be on the battlefield for a whole round in order to tap for the first copy. Get around this with a
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Goblin Warchief">Goblin Warchief</span>
    for haste.
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Mad Auntie">Mad Auntie</span>
    can also be a nice way to keep 
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Conspicuous Snoop">Conspicuous Snoop</span>
    safe from one destroy spell.
  </p>


  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve had a blast goldfishing this deck, each time I discover a slightly different line to the same
    inevitable end — a swift death to all opponents. This deck’s greatest weakness, and one that will
    become a problem if the deck happens to be as strong as it feels, is how much you love/need your
    commander. I imagine he will end up being quite the removal target. While none of the winning
    combos require
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Grenzo, Dungeon Warden">Grenzo</span>
    per se, he makes it a hell of a lot easier to get and survive to that point.
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Mad Auntie">Mad Auntie</span>
    is one way to protect him. Another option would be to let him hit the grave, and then bring him
    back to your library with something like
    <span class="card-hover" data-card-name="Tomb Trawler">Tomb Trawler</span>,
    but then you need to get him back in your hand. Potentially worth a tutor if he’s become insanely
    expensive, food for thought.
  </p>

  <p>Other than that, have fun!</p>
